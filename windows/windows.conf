# --- Steam Fixes ---

# 1. Force Main Steam Window to TILE
# We use 'float 0' and 'tile 1' to force tiling.
# We do NOT use 'fullscreen 0' because that prevents you from manually
# fullscreening Steam (e.g. Big Picture Mode) if you ever wanted to.
windowrule = float 0, match:class ^(steam)$, match:title ^(Steam)$

# 2. Ensure popups float (Friends, Settings, etc.)
windowrule = float 1, match:class ^(steam)$, match:title ^(Friends List|Settings|Properties)$

# --- Game Fixes (Excluding Steam) ---

# 1. Force Opacity for ALL XWayland apps (including Steam games)
windowrule = opacity 1.0 override 1.0 override, match:xwayland 1

# 2. Force Fullscreen (Hides Waybar) for Games BUT NOT Steam
# We match:
#   - It must be XWayland (match:xwayland 1)
#   - It must NOT be the Steam launcher (match:class negative:^(steam)$)
